Instead one should use numpy operations because they do not modify the original variable but create a copy. Another advantage is that you dont need for loops anymore for this. I rewrote the RescaleTransform function like this:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flgkno0mwkth6a%2F05281ab9676df8262c9dfdf24cc8f3472a1dcc00bff8d1432d217c856b640aca%2Fimage.png\" alt=\"image.pngNaN\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For me this fixed the issue, i hope this is what the instructors meant.</p>\n<p></p>"
